# MultiLabelClassification on EUR-Lex dataset
This is a team project on the task of multi-label classification on EUR-Lex data set. The dataset contains class imbalance problem. The goal is to be able to find suitable methods to recognize the labels on the documents.We considered Multinomial Naive Bayes, Convoultuion Neural Network and Stochastic Gradient Descent (with hinge loss functions, linear SVM) for implementation and evaluation of the EUR-Lex dataset. We evaluated our models using F1-score and hamming loss.
